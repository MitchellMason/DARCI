DISTRIBUTED AUGMENTED REALITY COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERACTIONS
=============================================================

Intro
=====
DARCI (Distributed Augmented Reality Communications And Interactions) is an undergraduate thesis project by Mitchell Mason. 
The aim of the project is to incorporate some more reality into virtual reality (hence the 'augmented' component.) The software
will use existing VR tech in the form of the Oculus Rift and the latest Kinect sensor to transmit scene data to another user. Think Skype but with goggles and a suped-up webcam. 

Compatibility
=============
Becuase of Microsoft requirements with the Kinect 2's SDK, this software will only be compatable with Windows 8.1. All other code will be compiled in a manner that is as cross-platform as possible. The user will also need a Kinect 2 sensor, and Oculus Rift DK2, and meet all hardware requirements for both devices simultaneously. For more information, see https://support.oculus.com/hc/en-us/articles/201835987-Oculus-Rift-Development-Kit-2-FAQ and http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/purchase/sensor_setup.aspx

Building
========
The project uses MS Visual Studio as the main project management system. Any 2014 version of VS should be compatable. The user should have installations of SDL 2, openGL 2.0 ES, the Kinect sdk, and the Oculus SDK. 

Usage
=====
Launch from the command line.
